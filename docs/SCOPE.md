# Project Scope

This document outlines the scope of the [`abio`](https://docs.rs/abio/latest/abio/)] crate.

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to reduce and/or eliminate "scope creep" or "feature creep". This crate is meant to be extremely specialized, catering to a very niche use-case. Thus, the scope should remain as small as possible. This library is meant to do one thing and to do that one thing extremely well.
