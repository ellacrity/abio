`Abi` trait cannot be derived for array-like types containing generic parameters
that are not decorated with the `packed` representation attribute.

Padding requirements cannot be verified.

To rectify this problem, you must choose one of the following:
  - Add the `packed` attribute to your type's `#[repr(...)]` attributes
  - Remove the generic parameter in favor of a concrete parameter that can be validated at compile time.
