# Progress and Milestones

## Milestone - 0.4.0

This crate has seen rapid development and many, many changes. I am as of this moment the sole contributor to this project. Due to this, the release has taken longer than I was hoping.

### What is Changing?

There are massive changes incoming to this repository. The code base has been completely refactored, and the public API has changed quite a bit. There are improvements to ergonomics, safety, soundness, and performance.

## Milestone - 0.3.0

This was already released and laid the initial foundation. This has since been heavily refactored.
